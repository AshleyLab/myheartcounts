MyHeartCounts Data Schemes

  - Passive Data Collector
      - Originally all three HealthKit types that were being collected were
      represented by the identifier displacement. Starting from
1.0.8 (I think)
      weve replaced displacement with below.
      - HealthKitWorkoutCollector
         - Collects HKWorkoutType
      - HealthKitDataCollector
         - Collects HKQuantityType
      - HealthKitSleepCollector
         - Collects HKCategoryType which is just sleep for now
      - motionActivityCollector
         - Collects CMMotionActivityManager
            - Motion data reflects whether the user is walking, running, in
            a vehicle, or stationary for periods of time.



   - 6 Minute Walk Test
      - 6MWT Displacement Data
         - Displacement data generated from lon, lat data from ResearchKit.
